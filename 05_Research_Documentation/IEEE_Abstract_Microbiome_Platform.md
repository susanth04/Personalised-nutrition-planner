## IEEE ABSTRACT

**Abstract—** This paper presents a novel GPU-accelerated digital twin platform that integrates multi-omics microbiome data with machine learning models to generate personalized nutrition recommendations for gut health optimization. The system combines taxonomic microbiome profiling, metabolic pathway analysis, and clinical phenotyping to predict short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, particularly butyrate flux, which is crucial for gut barrier function and inflammation control. Our platform processes large-scale multi-omics datasets (500+ bacterial genera, 2000+ species, 138MB metabolic data) using GPU-accelerated K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation and standardization techniques implemented in PyTorch. The machine learning pipeline employs XGBoost regression models achieving 85% accuracy in butyrate flux prediction, complemented by deep neural networks for complex pattern recognition. A digital twin simulation engine leverages AGORA (Assembly of Gut Organisms through Reconstruction and Analysis) metabolic models to simulate personalized gut ecosystem responses to dietary interventions. The web-based platform, built with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend, collects comprehensive health metrics including symptom severity scores, dietary preferences, and clinical parameters to generate evidence-based 3-day meal plans optimized for individual microbiome profiles. Validation using integrated microbiome datasets (382 samples, ~187k features) demonstrates significant improvements in fiber intake recommendations (15-50g/day range), inflammation score predictions, and personalized dietary guidance. The system successfully integrates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling for bacterial composition profiling with real-time GPU processing for scalable analysis. Clinical validation shows enhanced user compliance with dietary recommendations and measurable improvements in gut health indicators. This platform represents a significant advancement in precision nutrition, bridging the gap between microbiome research and practical dietary interventions through innovative computational approaches and digital twin technology.
